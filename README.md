# CodeCampFitnessapp
Android Fitness Application for ComTec CodeCamp



Whitelisted Facebook account that has to be used for the sharing functionality:

Email and password:

codecamp1

Alternatively your accounts can be whitelisted too, just ask for it in the group chat or hit me up with some DMs :D
I would like to generally allow all accounts but facebook doesn't let you do that if they haven't tested your app yet :/ ... another reason to implement the android easy share thingy ;)
